# 🚀 Muhamad Rafiq Iqbal | Aspiring Data Engineer  

**🔍 Mechanical Engineer turned Data Scientist | Passionate about Big Data & Cloud Engineering**  

## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I am a **Mechanical Engineering graduate** currently pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science** with a dream to become a **Data Engineer**. My journey into the **Big Data ecosystem** started with a curiosity for handling massive datasets, building scalable data pipelines, and optimizing distributed systems. Now, I am deep-diving into **Hadoop, Apache Spark, Cloud Technologies (GCP, AWS), and Data Warehousing** to make my dream a reality! 🚀  

## ⚡ Tech Stack  
🔥 **Big Data Technologies:** Hadoop | Apache Spark | HDFS | Kafka  
☁️ **Cloud Platforms:** Google Cloud (GCS, BigQuery, Data Fusion) | AWS  
🛢 **Databases & Warehousing:** SQL | PostgreSQL | Snowflake | MongoDB  
📊 **Data Processing & ETL:** Apache Spark | Airflow | Cloud Data Fusion  
📌 **Programming:** Python | SQL | Bash  

## 📂 Featured Projects  
### 🔹 [GCP Climate Data Pipeline]([https://github.com/Rafiqbal/GCP-Climate-Data-Pipeline](https://github.com/Rafiqbal/AssesingClimateTrendsUsingGoogleCloudPlatform)
✅ Built an **end-to-end data pipeline** on **Google Cloud** (GCS, Data Fusion, BigQuery, Looker Studio).  
✅ Ingested **climate change datasets** and performed analysis on **CO2 emissions, temperature trends, and deforestation**.  

### 🔹 [Apache Spark ETL Project]([https://github.com/Rafiqbal/Apache-Spark-Data-Processing](https://github.com/Rafiqbal/Big-Data-Using-Hadoop-and-Spark)  
✅ Processed **millions of records** using **PySpark & Hadoop**.
